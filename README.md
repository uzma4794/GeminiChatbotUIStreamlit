# GeminiChatbotUIStreamlit
It is first try to make Chatbot using Google API Key 
Gemini model is used for Text prompt (prompt means your input ) to text response. 
[Google API Creation Link](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key?authuser=1)
As API key is the pass to fetch the service of particular platform it is necessary to hide that key from public. So create .env file and .gitignore file and put .env into .gitignore because .gitignore ignores all files in its umbrella.
